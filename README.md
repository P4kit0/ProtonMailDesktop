# ProtonMailDesktop

This project is a desktop application that allows you to access ProtonMail, a secure email service, directly from your desktop.

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, please make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website at https://nodejs.org. Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is usually installed along with Node.js. However, it's important to ensure that npm is properly configured and accessible from the command line. You can verify this by opening a command prompt or terminal and running the command `npm -v`. If npm is not recognized, please refer to the official Node.js documentation to troubleshoot the installation.

## Compilation

You can compile the application from the source code by executing the appropriate script based on your operating system. 

## Download

If you prefer to download the final program, please visit the Releases page and download the version that matches your operating system (Windows or Debian).

Please note that this application is still under development, and you may encounter bugs or issues. Feel free to report any problems you encounter or contribute to the project by submitting pull requests.
