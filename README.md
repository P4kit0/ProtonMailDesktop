# ProtonMailDesktop
This project is a desktop application that allows you to access Proton Mail, a secure email service, directly from your desktop.


This .bat script installs the ProtonMail application on your system. Before running the script, please make sure you meet the following requirements:

Requirements
Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website at https://nodejs.org. Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.
npm (Node Package Manager): npm is usually installed along with Node.js. However, it's important to ensure that npm is properly configured and accessible from the command line. You can verify this by opening a command prompt or terminal and running the command npm -v. If npm is not recognized, please refer to the official Node.js documentation to troubleshoot the installation.

You can compile the application from the source code by executing the appropriate script based on your operating system. If you prefer to download the final program, please visit the Releases page and download the version that matches your operating system (Windows or Debian).
